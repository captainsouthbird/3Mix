Super Mario Bros 3Mix Hack

The spectacular, full-scale hack of SMB3! Implementing concepts from many games that came well after the original title.

Provided in hopes that it will be useful to others. Please give credit if you base another project on this source!

Specifically for use with NESASM (https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm)

NOTE: Included are support files for my "NoDice" level editor (game.xml and "icons" subdirectory) and "MusConv" (musconv.xml) utilities. They are not part of the actual source code required to build the ROM, but are necessary if you intend to use these tools.

-------------

To assemble, simply run:

nesasm 3mix.asm
