These are MIDIs that were engineered to work with MUSCONV as part of 3Mix's development. They're not designed to be good-sounding MIDIs... just MIDIs that could be translated into the SMB3 NES realm. Some of these are also completely unused or are test/WIP versions.

Most or all of them came from vgmusic.com, and I regret that I did not properly track who made which ones originally. Of course, these are generally so degraded that it does the original artist no proper representation, but I still should have been better at that.

If you want to claim credit for any of these, just let me know (@cptsouthbird) and I'll put it in this file if I can verify it.
